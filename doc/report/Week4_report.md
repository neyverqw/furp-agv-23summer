### Literature Review 
[Toward Energy-Efficient Routing of Multiple AGVs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](../papers/Paper5.pdf)

**Keyword:** 
- Automated guided vehicles 
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning 
- Task assignment 
- Path planning 
- Energy consumption

**Main Idea:**
Propose an [Math Processing Error]-greedy MADDPG algorithm which is able to converge faster and achieve better performance during training by balancing exploration and exploitation. Modifications are made to the action and state space to fit the setting of AGV activities, while a well-designed reward function is incorporated into the proposed algorithm that optimizes energy consumption while fulfilling all tasks.

**What do you think can be used in our project** 

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to address the scheduling and routing problems of multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs), with the goal of minimizing overall energy consumption.
