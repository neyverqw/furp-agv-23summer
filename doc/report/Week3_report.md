### Literature Review 
[A branch-and-bound approach for AGV dispatching and routing problems in automated container terminals](../papers/Paper4.pdf) 

[Website is here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835222000389)

**Keyword:** 
- Conflict-free routes
- AGV dispatching
- Path planning
- Bidirectional path
- Branch-and-bound

**Main Idea:**
In this research, we adopt the layout which is the bidirectional path structure with multiple parallel travel paths and multiple shortcuts. Present a MIP model for ADRP to determine the operation job, operation sequence, and conflict-free travel route. Second, considering that this model is usually computationally challenging for even small-scale problem instances because of the extremely large number of feasible assignment schemes and routes, we develop a tailored branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm based on the characteristics of the problem to solve the ADRP efficiently. 

**What do you think can be used in our project**
