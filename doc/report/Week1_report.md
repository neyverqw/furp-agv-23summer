# Week 1 report 
### Project Work

- What did you learn
   - Have a general understanding of ROS based on [Note](http://www.autolabor.com.cn/book/ROSTutorials/)
- what did you try
   - Try three methods of ROS communication machine production.
   - Download Isaac Sim.
- what problems did you encounter, and how did you solve them
   - 32GB RAM needed to run the Isaac Sim. But my laptop just 16GB RAM.

### Literature Review 
[Swarm intelligence algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles collaboration: a comprehensive review](../papers/Paper1.pdf) <font color="red">**!!!  Important**</font>

[Website is here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-022-10281-7)

**Keyword:** 
- Swarm intelligence 
- Collision avoidance  
- Task assignment 
- Path planning 
- Formation reconfiguration

**Main Idea:** The study focuses on four aspects we consider relevant for the topic: collision avoidance, task assignment, path planning, and formation reconfiguration. A comprehensive investigation of selected typical algorithms that analyses their merits and demerits in the context of multi-UAV collaboration is presented. 

**What do you think can be used in our project**

- 3D space with cooperative detection

- Task assignment

- Path planning

[A review of swarm intelligence algorithms deployment for scheduling and optimization in cloud computing environments](../papers/Paper2.pdf)

[Website is here](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-696/)

**Keyword:** 
- particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
- ant colony optimization (ACO)
- artificial bee colony (ABC)
- the firefly algorithm (FA)


**What do you think can be used in our project**
- Learn what algorithm may useful in out project
- Spark ideas

**My immature inspiration**

Apply 3D ant colony in three-dimensional space (x axis y axis time axis)

Use genetic algorithm to determinte the best optimal order of AGVs that apply ant colony algorithm

The AGV apply in ant colony algorithm can be seen as barrier for next AGV (based on the ord generate by genetic algorithm)
